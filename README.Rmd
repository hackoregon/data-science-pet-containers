# Data Science Pet Containers
M. Edward (Ed) Borasky <znmeb@znmeb.net>, `r Sys.Date()`

## Setting up
1. Clone this repository and `cd data-science-pet-containers/containers`.
2. Define the environment variables.
    * Copy the file `sample.env` to `.env`. For security reasons, `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so it ***won't*** be checked into version control. 
    * Edit `.env`. The variables you need to define are
        * `HOST_POSTGRES_PORT`: If you have PostgreSQL installed on your host, it's probably listening on port 5432. The `postgis` service listens on port 5432 inside the Docker network, so you'll need to map its port 5432 to another port. Set `HOST_POSTGRES_PORT` to the value you want; 5439 is what I use.
        * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: To connect to the `postgis` service, you need a user name and a password. The user name is the default, the database superuser `postgres`. Docker will set the password for the `postgres` user in the `postgis` service to the value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

    Here's `sample.env`:
    
    ```
    # postgis container
    HOST_POSTGRES_PORT=5439
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=some.string.you.can.remember.that.nobody.else.can.guess
    ```

## Automatic database restores
When the `postgis` service first starts, it initializes the database. After that, it looks in a directory called `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` and restores any `.sql` or `sql.gz` files it finds. Then it looks for `.sh` scripts and runs them.

We use this to restore databases as follows:

* For any database you want restored, create a file `<dbname>.backup` with either a pgAdmin `Backup` operation or with `pg_dump`. The file must be in [`pg_dump` format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgdump.html).
* Before running `docker-compose`, copy those backup files into `data-science-pet-containers/containers/Backups`. Note that `.gitignore` is set for `*.backup`, so these backup files won't be version-controlled.
* At build time, Docker copies the backup files into `/home/postgres/Backups` on the `postgis` image. And it places a script `restore-all.sh` in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. ***If you change any of the backups, you will need to rebuild the `postgis` image.***
* The first time the image runs, `restore-all.sh` will restore all the `.backup` files it finds in `/home/postgres/Backups`. 

    `restore-all.sh` creates a new database with the same name as the file. For example, `passenger_census.backup` will be restored to a freshly-created database called `passenger_census`. The new databases will have the owner `postgres`.

## Starting the services
1. Choose your version:

    * `postgis.yml`: PostGIS only. If you're doing all the analysis on the host and just want the PostGIS service and its restored databases, choose this.     
    * `miniconda.yml`: PostGIS and Miniconda. Choose this if you want to run a Jupyter notebook server inside the Docker network.
    * `rstudio.yml`: PostGIS and RStudio Server. Choose this if you want an RStudio Server inside the Docker network.

2. Type `docker-compose -f <version> up -d --build`. Docker will build/rebuild the images and start the services.

## Using the services

### PostGIS

The `postgis` service is based on the official PostgreSQL image from the Docker Store: <https://store.docker.com/images/postgres>. It is running PostgreSQL 10, PostGIS 2.4, pgRouting 2.5 and all of the foreign data wrappers that are available in a Debian PostgreSQL server. All of these images acquire PostgreSQL and its accomplices from the official PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) Debian repositories: <https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/>.

Connecting to the service:
    * From the host, connect to `localhost`, port `HOST_POSTGRES_PORT`.
    * Inside the Docker network, connect to `postgis`, port 5432.
    * In both cases, the username and maintenance database are `postgres` and the password is `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

#### Connecting with pgAdmin on the host
If you've installed the EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL distribution, you probably already have pgAdmin, although it may not be the latest version. Here are the links if you want to install it without PostgreSQL:

* macOS installer: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-macos/
* Windows: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/

To connect to the `postgis` service on `localhost:HOST_POSTGRES_PORT` with pgAdmin:

1. Right-click on `Servers` and create a server. Give it any name you want. 
2. On the `Connection` tab, set the host to `localhost`, the port to `HOST_POSTGRES_PORT`, the maintenance database to `postgres`, the user name to `postgres` and the password to the value you set for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. 
3. Check the `Save password` box and press the `Save` button. `pgAdmin` will add the tree for the `postgis` service.

#### Using the command line in the `postgis` server
There are two Linux accounts available, `root`, the Linux superuser, and `postgres`, the database superuser. Type `docker exec -it -u <account> containers_postgis_1 /bin/bash` and you'll be logged in.

I've tried to provide a comprehensive command line experience. `Git` and `vim` are there, as is most of the command-line GIS stack (`gdal`, `proj`, `spatialite`, `rasterlite`, `geotiff`, `osm2pgsql` and `osm2pgrouting`), and of course `psql`. I've also included `python3-csvkit` for Excel, CSV and other text files, `unixodbc` for ODBC connections and `mdbtools` for Microsoft Access files.

### Miniconda
This service is based on the Anaconda, Inc. (formerly Continuum) `miniconda3` image: <https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/miniconda3/>. I've added a non-root user `jupyter` to avoid the security issues associated with running Jupyter notebooks as "root". All of the command line tools from the `postgis` image except `osm2pgsql` and `osm2pgrouting` are available.

By default the Jupyter notebook server starts when Docker brings up the service. Type `docker logs containers_miniconda_1`. You'll see something like this:

    ```
    $ docker logs containers_miniconda_1 
    [I 02:40:47.554 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /home/jupyter/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/jupyter
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=865963175cdf86fd8fb6c98a6ef880803cb9f1ef6cf10960
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
    [C 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] 
    
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=865963175cdf86fd8fb6c98a6ef880803cb9f1ef6cf10960
    ```

Browse to `localhost:8888` and copy/paste the token when the server asks for it.

The Jupyter "New Terminal" works, but the terminal comes up in `sh` instead of `bash`. So if you use the terminal, type `bash; source activate jupyter` to get a `bash` prompt.

### RStudio
This service is based on the `rocker/rstudio` image from Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio/>. All of the command line tools from the `postgis` image are available.

Browse to `localhost:8787`. The user name and password are both `rstudio`. ***Note that if you're using Firefox, you'll have to adjust a setting to use the terminal feature.*** Go to `Tools -> Global Options -> Terminal`. For Firefox, you need to uncheck the `Connect with WebSockets` option. Other browsers I've tried, Microsoft Edge and Chromium, don't need this.

## About the name
This all started with an infamous "cattle, not pets" blog post. For some history, see <http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/>. In the Red Hat / Kubernetes / OpenShift universe, it's common for people to have a workstation that's essentially a Docker / Kubernetes host with all the actual work being done in containers. See <https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2016/06/08/in-defense-of-the-pet-container-part-1-prelude-the-only-constant-is-complexity/> and <https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2018/02/fedora-atomic-workstation/>.

So - pet containers for data scientists.
