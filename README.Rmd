# Data Science Pet Containers
M. Edward (Ed) Borasky <znmeb@znmeb.net>, `r Sys.Date()`

## Setting up
1. Clone this repository and `cd data-science-pet-containers/containers`.
2. You will need to define some environment variables. Some of the services have login IDs and passwords you'll need to define, and some will need their internal Docker network ports mapped into ports on the Docker host `localhost` IP address.

    Copy the file `sample.env` to `.env`. For security reasons, `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so it *won't* be checked into version control. Edit `.env`. The variables you need to define are

    * `HOST_POSTGRES_PORT`: If you have PostgreSQL installed on your host, it's probably listening on port 5432. The `postgis` service listens on port 5432 inside the Docker network, so you'll need to map its port 5432 to another port. Set `HOST_POSTGRES_PORT` to the value you want; 5439 is what I use.
    * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: To connect to the `postgis` service, you need a user name and a password. The user name is the default, `postgres`. Docker will set the password for the `postgres` user in the `postgis` service to the value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
    * `HOST_PGADMIN_PORT`: The `pgadmin` service is a web server that listens on port 80 inside the Docker network. Docker will map that port into port `HOST_PGADMIN_PORT` on `localhost`.
    * `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`, `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`: You log in to the `pgadmin` web service with an email address and password. Docker will set the email address to `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`. `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` is the password.
    * `HOST_RSTUDIO_PORT`: The `rstudio` service listens on port 8787. Docker will map that port into `HOST_RSTUDIO_PORT` on `localhost`.

    Here's `sample.env`:
    
    ```
    # postgis container
    HOST_POSTGRES_PORT=5439
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=some.string.you.can.remember.that.nobody.else.can.guess

    # pgadmin4 container
    HOST_PGADMIN_PORT=8080
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=znmeb@znmeb.net
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=some.string.you.can.remember.that.nobody.else.can.guess

    # rstudio server container
    HOST_RSTUDIO_PORT=8786
    ```

## Automatic database restores
When the `postgis` service first starts, it initializes the database. After that, it looks in a directory called `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` and restores any `.sql` or `sql.gz` files it finds. Then it looks for `.sh` scripts and runs them.

We use this to restore databases as follows:

* For any database you want restored, create a file `<dbname>.backup` with either a pgAdmin `Backup` operation or with `pg_dump`. The file must be in [`pg_dump` format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgdump.html).
* Before running `docker-compose`, copy those backup files into `data-science-pet-containers/containers/Backups`. Note that `.gitignore` is set for `*.backup`, so these backup files won't be version-controlled.
* At build time, Docker copies the backup files into `/home/postgres/Backups` on the `postgis` image. And it places a script `restore-all.sh` in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`.
* The first time the image runs, `restore-all.sh` will restore all the `.backup` files it finds in `/home/postgres/Backups`. `restore-all.sh` creates a new database with the same name as the file; for example, `passenger_census.backup` will be restored to a freshly-created database called `passenger_census`.

## Starting the services
1. Choose your version:

    * `small.yml`: PostGIS and pgAdmin only. If you're doing all the analysis on the host and just want the PostGIS service and its restored databases, choose this.     
    * `medium.yml`: PostGIS, pgAdmin, and Jupyter. Choose this if you want to run a Jupyter notebook server inside the Docker network.
    * `large.yml`: PostGIS, pgAdmin, Jupyter, and RStudio. Choose this if you want both Jupyter and RStudio Server. This is the version I use.
2. Type `docker-compose -f <version> up -d --build`. Docker will build/rebuild the images and start the services.

## Using the services

### PostGIS and pgAdmin

The `postgis` service is based on the official PostgreSQL image from the Docker Store: <https://store.docker.com/images/postgres>. It is running PostgreSQL 10, PostGIS 2.4, pgRouting and all of the foreign data wrappers that are available in a Debian PostgreSQL server. Note that all of these images except `pgadmin` acquire PostgreSQL and its accomplices from the official PostgreSQL Debian repositories: <https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/>.

pgAdmin is available in two forms - as a desktop application and as a web application. This service is the web application. *Note that it can only access PostgreSQL services inside the Docker network*.

The `pgadmin` service is based on an experimental image: <https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4/>. The Dockerfile is here: <https://github.com/postgres/pgadmin4/blob/master/pkg/docker/Dockerfile>. Unlike the other images, it's based on CentOS rather than Debian.

#### Connecting with pgAdmin on the host
If you have pgAdmin on your host, you'll be able to connect to the `postgis` service on `localhost:HOST_POSTGRES_PORT` with it. Right-click on `Servers` and create a server. Give it any name you want. Then on the `Connection` tab, set the host to `localhost`, the port to `HOST_POSTGRES_PORT`, the maintenance database to `postgres`, the user name to `postgres` and the password to the value you set for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Check the `Save password` box and press the `Save` button. `pgAdmin` will add the tree for the `postgis` service.

#### Connecting with the `pgadmin` service inside the Docker network.
Browse to port `HOST_PGADMIN_PORT` on `localhost`. It will grind for a while, then give you a login form. The email address is the one you set in `.env` for `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL` and the password is the one you set for `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`. After you log in, it will grind for a while again; this only happens the first time.

Then you'll get the pgAdmin tree on the left. Right-click on `Servers` and create a server. Give it any name you want. Then on the `Connection` tab, set the host to `postgis`, the port to `5432`, the maintenance database to `postgres`, the user name to `postgres` and the password to the value you set for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Check the `Save password` box and press the `Save` button. `pgAdmin` will add the tree for the `postgis` service.

### Jupyter
This service is based on the Anaconda, Inc. (formerly Continuum) `miniconda3` image: <https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/miniconda3/>. I've added a non-root user `jupyter` and created a Conda environment also named `jupyter` in its home directory. I've only put `jupyter` and `psycopg2` in the `jupyter` environment for now. The `vim` editor is also available.

By default the Jupyter notebook server starts when Docker brings up the service. Type `docker logs containers_jupyter_1`. You'll see something like this:

    ```
    $ docker logs containers_jupyter_1 
    [I 02:40:47.554 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /home/jupyter/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/jupyter
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=865963175cdf86fd8fb6c98a6ef880803cb9f1ef6cf10960
    [I 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
    [C 02:40:47.877 NotebookApp] 
    
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=865963175cdf86fd8fb6c98a6ef880803cb9f1ef6cf10960
    ```

That link is where you want to point your browser. Or you can just browse to `localhost:8888` and paste the token when it asks for it.

The Jupyter "New Terminal" works, but the terminal is coming up in `sh` instead of `bash`. So if you use the terminal, type `bash; source activate jupyter` to get a `bash` prompt.

### RStudio
This service is based on the `rocker/rstudio` image from Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio/>. I've added some database connectivity tools and the `vim` editor.

Browse to `localhost` on `HOST_RSTUDIO_PORT`. The user name and password are both `rstudio`. Note that if you're using Firefox, you'll have to adjust a setting to use the terminal feature. Go to `Tools -> Global Options -> Terminal`. For Firefox, you need to uncheck the `Connect with WebSockets` option. Other browsers I've tried, Microsoft Edge and Chromium, don't need this.

## Integration with host data volumes
TBD

## About the name
This all started with an infamous "cattle, not pets" blog post. For some history, see <http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/>. In the Red Hat / Kubernetes / OpenShift universe, it's common for people to have a workstation that's essentially a Docker / Kubernetes host with all the actual work being done in containers. See <https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2016/06/08/in-defense-of-the-pet-container-part-1-prelude-the-only-constant-is-complexity/> and <https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2018/02/fedora-atomic-workstation/>.

So - pet containers for data scientists.
