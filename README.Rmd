```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup
1. Make sure you have reliable power and internet bandwidth. The build phase does a fair amount of downloading. Install Docker hosting if you haven't already - Docker Community Edition or its equivalent. You will need the `docker` and `docker-compose` executables in your `PATH`.
2. Clone this repository and `cd data-science-pet-containers/containers`.
3. Define the environment variables in a file called `.env`. Note that this file is in `.gitignore` and will ***not*** be version-controlled. The variables you need to define are

* HOST_POSTGRES_PORT: The `postgis` service listens on port 5432. Docker will map that port into this port on `localhost`.
* POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Docker will set the password for the `postgres` user in the `postgis` service to this value.
* HOST_PGADMIN_PORT: The `pgadmin4` service listens on port 80. Docker will map that port into this port on `localhost`.
* PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: You log in to the `pgadmin4` web service with an email address and password. Docker will set the email address to this value.
* PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: The password
* HOST_RSTUDIO_PORT: The `rstudio` service listens on port 8787. Docker will map that port into this port on `localhost`.

Here's a sample `.env` you can paste and edit to your liking:
```
# postgis container
HOST_POSTGRES_PORT=5439
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=some.string.you.can.remember.that.nobody.else.can.guess

# pgadmin4 container
HOST_PGADMIN_PORT=8080
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=znmeb@znmeb.net
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=some.string.you.can.remember.that.nobody.else.can.guess

# rstudio server container
HOST_RSTUDIO_PORT=8786
```
4. Type `docker-compose build`. Wait. On my workstation (4 GHz 8 core, 60 mbits/second download) it takes about 15 minutes. Docker will create a network called `containers_default` and build the images.
