Note: For some browsers, the RStudio `New Terminal` operation doesn't work. I've seen this in Firefox on both Windows and Linux, but not in other browsers.

If the terminal isn't working, go into the `Tools -> Global Options -> Terminal` settings and uncheck the `Connect with Websockets` option, then press `OK`. If that doesn't fix it, open an issue.
