# Oregon Geocoder as a Docker image

## Linux hosting

### Prerequisites
* Docker Community Edition (stable): Docker version 17.12.0-ce (2017-12-27) or later. Don't use the "Edge" version; I don't test with it.
* docker-compose: docker-compose version 1.18.0 (2017-12-18) or later, and
* PostgreSQL 10 client (psql, pgadmin4, etc.) on your host if you want to access the container from the host. Don't use `pgadmin3` if you can avoid it; it's obsolete and not well-supported.
* Note: I am currently testing on an Arch Linux system.
  ```
  docker-compose version 1.18.0, build unknown
  Docker version 18.01.0-ce, build 03596f51b1
  ```

* Host disk space for persistence. The build process mounts two host directories as volumes inside containers. If they do not exist, Docker will create them with the correct permissions / ownership.
        
    1. `/d/gisdata` is mounted in the containers as `/gisdata`. This is where the database population scripts save the downloaded TIGER/LineÂ® shapefiles. ***Note that if you run this a few times, the Census Bureau will blacklist your IP address. So make sure you back this area up somewhere. As long as you have all the data, the scripts will run correctly even if you're blacklisted.***

        `/d/gisdata` is also where the scripts save the `pg_dump` of the geocoder database. This directory will have UID and GID 999, which corresponds to the `postgres` user and group in the containers. Don't change this!` `/data/gisdata` is currently about 1.6 GB. The `geocoder.backup` file is about 848 MB.

    2. `/d/pgdata` is mounted in the containers as `/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata`. This is where the containers keep their PostgreSQL data. This is also UID and GID 999. For the geocoders, this is easily recreated, either by re-running the scripts or by restoring `geocoder.backup` in `/data/gisdata`. But for other applications, you'll want to be careful not to corrupt it with host processes. `/d/pgdata` with just the Oregon geocoder database is currently about 2.7 GB.

### Buidling the database and the images
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal and type `cd data-science-pet-containers/examples/geocoding`.
3. Environment variables: to build the images and run the geocoder, you need to define some environment variables. First, copy the file `sample.env` to the hidden file `.env`. Then edit `.env` and change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` value to a strong password. You do not need to change any other variables.
4. Type `./make-images.bash`. It will take a while to run; it is downloading shapefiles, unpacking them and inserting the contents into the database. You can ignore errors and warnings.
5. When the data acquisition is complete you'll see something like

    ```

    geocoder_1  |  r |        lon        |       lat        |              paddress

    geocoder_1  | --------------------------------------+------------------------------+--------
    geocoder_1  |  101 NE Grand Ave, Portland, OR 97232 | POINT(-122.660702 45.523645) |      3
    geocoder_1  |  100 NE Grand Ave, Portland, OR 97232 | POINT(-122.660702 45.523645) |      3
    geocoder_1  |  98 NE Grand Ave, Portland, OR 97232  | POINT(-122.660702 45.523645) |      3
    geocoder_1  | (3 rows)
    ```

    When those messages appear, type `CTRL-C` to stop the service. The script will then shut down the service.

At this point you have

1. `/d/gisdata/geocoder.backup` - the geocoder database suitable for `pg_restore`,
2. Downloaded shapefiles in `/d/gisdata/www2.census.gov/`,
3. A PostgreSQL / PostGIS database in `/d/pgdata`,
4. A Docker image: `geocoder`.  The image is the image the scripts used to download the shapefiles and populate the database. Thus it has copies of all the scripts. Both are about 467 MB.

### Running the geocoder
To start the service, type `docker-compose up -d`. `docker-compose` will start the service and you'll see `Creating geocoding_geocoder_1 ... done
`

You'll be able to connect from the Docker host to PostGIS in the container as the database superuser `postgres` on host `localhost` port `5439` with the password you set above. Note that the port is ***5439*** to avoid conflicts with your host PostgreSQL service, which usually listens on port 5432.

Testing: type

```
./test-geocoder.bash
```

You'll see the Hack Oregon headquarters geocoded! The second table is the geocode for the intersection of Couch Street and Grand Avenue.
