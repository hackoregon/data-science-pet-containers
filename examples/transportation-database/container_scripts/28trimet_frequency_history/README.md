# TRIMET FREQUENCY SCRAPING
## Instructions

`download_GTFS_archive.py`

### TO RUN:
`python download_GTFS_archive.py -d <YOUR_DESTINATION_FOLDER_PATH>`

Passing a `-h` flag shows the help message to tell you the same thing.

### NOTES:
There's 34 pages. I believe we are only really interested in data back to 2012. So you could stop the download ~ page 14 if it's taking a while.
