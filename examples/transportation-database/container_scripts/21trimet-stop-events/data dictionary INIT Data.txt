Data Dictionary
TriMet raw data.
Miles J. Crumley, MS - Operations Analyst: Bus Transportation/Maintenance

You have been provided with many tables:
	init_tripsh - Init Trip Data Historical
	init_veh_stop - Init Stop data Historical
	init_cyclic - INIT vehicle moving data
	trimet_stop_event - TriMet Stop Event Data

Date Range: Sep, Oct, Nov 2017
All Bus data
Stop Event Rail data.
Route Numbers that are 921,922 are deadhead routes. You can exclude them from analysis but their points are still valuable for evaulating deadheads.
Block Numbers that end in 99 and descending is fill service. You can exclude that from regular analysis but it is still important to us because it allows us 
	to better understand service restoration
Anything else that looks "weird" can likely be excluded.

Table: init_veh_stop - INIT Stop Level Data
OPD_DATE- Service Date
VEHICLE_ID - Vehicle ID, most likely coded as text
BLOCK_CODE - Our Assigned block . Service Key 
	Blocks that end in 99 are generally extra service blocks or unscheduled blocks for broken service.
	Service Keys
		W = Weekday
		S = Saturday
		U = Sunday
		X = Holiday/Extra Service
EVENT_NO_STOP - joins to Table: init_cyclic.EVENT_NO_STOP
METERS - Distance travelled in meters
ACT_ARR_TIME - Actual Arrival Time. Time is coded in seconds from midnight and can be greater than 86400
ACT_DEP_TIME - Actual Departure Time
NOM_ARR_TIME - Scheduled Arrival Time
NOM_DEP_TIME - Scheduled Departure Time
POINT_ID - TriMet Stop ID
DOORS_OPENING - Whether Doors Opened or not
	0 = Open
	1 = Closed
STOP_TYPE 
	0,5 – Service Stop
		'bay' - typically 15 meters before and 10 meters after a stop.
	2 – Unplanned door open 
		Door open in the 'encatchment' which is 4% of distance to next stop. 
		Max Length is 60 meters after stop
		This includes the stop 'bay'
	3 – Disturbance stop 
		Records when bus stopped for ~ 5s but not at an actual stop 'bay'
	4,6 – Drive thru (passed by stop but did not serve it)
	7 – Timepoint (not a stop) - These are hidden from customers
GPS_LATITUDE - Recorded Latitude in  WGS1984 (4326)
GPS_LONGITUDE - Recorded Longitude in WGS1984 (4326)
DOOR_OPEN_TIME - How long the door was open. This is the true "dwell" and is normally less than the difference between act_dep_time and act_arr_time
