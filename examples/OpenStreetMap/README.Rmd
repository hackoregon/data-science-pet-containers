## Required resources
This example is a bit demanding. It runs in two phases:

1. Downloading and preparing the OpenStreetMap data.
2. Populating and backing up a database.

The first phase should run fine in a Docker container. But the second phase, creating a `pgRouting` database of the TriMet service area, requires a bit over 4 GB of RAM to run. 

As a result, the second phase won't run on my 8 GB laptop in Docker, which only allocates 2 GB of RAM to ***all*** the containers. It should run with any Docker host big enough to allocate 5 GB of RAM to the `postgis` container. It only requires the `postgis` container.

## Running the scripts
1. Get a Docker host with enough RAM to run it.
2. Bring up the `postgis` service with `docker-compose`.
3. Log in to the container as `postgres`.
4. Run the `download-data.bash` script. It will
    * Download the TriMet boundary shapefile and convert it to GeoJSON.
    * Extract the bounding box from the GeoJSON.
    * Download the most recent OpenStreetMap dataset for Oregon. This appears to be the smallest dataset that includes the Portland metro area.
    * Create a dataset with just the data inside the bounding box.
5. Run the `make-routing-database.bash` script. As noted above, this requires over 4 GB of RAM. The script will
    * Create a database `osm_routing`.
    * Create the `postgis`, `pgrouting` and `hstore` extensions in the database.
    * Create and populate three schemas, one for each mode: "cars", "bicycles" and "pedestrian." This part takes some time - about 15 minutes for each mode on my workstation.
    * Create a `pg_dump` backup of the database. The backup is currently about 736 megabytes.
