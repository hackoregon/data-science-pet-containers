Using Docker from Windows 10 Pro / Windows Subsystem for Linux / Ubuntu
================

Getting started
---------------

1.  You'll need Windows 10 Pro and Docker for Windows installed.
2.  Install Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) from the Microsoft Store.
3.  Read the blog post that explains what you're going to do - <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/12/08/cross-post-wsl-interoperability-with-docker/>.

Installation
------------

1.  Open an Ubuntu terminal.
2.  Clone this repository. Both `https` and `ssh` now work, and the line endings issues from previous versions have been fixed.
3.  `cd data-science-pet-containers/win10pro-wsl-ubuntu-tools`. Run the script `install-docker-relay.bash`. This implements the manual steps in the blog post. It also installs the correct version of `docker-compose`; see <https://github.com/hackoregon/data-science-pet-containers/issues/38> for the issue.
4.  Close the terminal when the install finishes.

Running
-------

1.  Open a new Ubuntu terminal.
2.  `cd data-science-pet-containers/win10pro-wsl-ubuntu-tools`.
3.  `sudo ~/docker-relay`. Enter your password if necessary. The relay process is now running.
4.  Open another Ubuntu terminal.
5.  `cd data-science-pet-containers/containers`. The standard Docker commands should now work. One caution: make sure you are using `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose`, not the Windows executable `docker-compose.exe`.
